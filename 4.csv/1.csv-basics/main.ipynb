    "### What is CSV?\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV stands for **Comma-Separated Values**. It's a simple text-based file format used to store tabular data ‚Äî like a spreadsheet ‚Äî where each line represents a row and columns are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use CSV?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Widely used format for data exchange\n",
    "- Easy to read and write\n",
    "- Supported by tools like Excel, Google Sheets, databases, and most programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python and CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides multiple ways to handle CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`csv` module (built-in)**  \n",
    "   - Offers full control over reading/writing CSV files\n",
    "   - Can customize delimiters, quote characters, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`pandas` (external library)**  \n",
    "   - Simplifies reading, analyzing, and manipulating CSV data\n",
    "   - Ideal for working with large or complex datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Delimiter**: The character used to separate values (`,` by default)\n",
    "- **Header**: The first row (optional) that contains column names\n",
    "- **Row**: A line of values (representing a record)\n",
    "- **Field**: A single value within a row (a cell)\n",

    "### Why csv.DictReader / csv.DictWriter is Often Better Than the Regular Versions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Readability\n",
    "With DictReader, each row is a dictionary like {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'} instead of a list like ['John', 'Doe', 'john@example.com'].\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With DictReader:\n",
    "    print(row['first_name'])  # clearer\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With csv.reader:\n",
    "    print(row[0])  # less readable and more error-prone\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Less Prone to Column Order Errors\n",
    "Regular csv.reader relies on column index, which can break your code if the CSV structure changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "DictReader works by column name, so it‚Äôs more flexible and resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Easier Column Selection/Exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    del line['email']\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can remove fields easily by name‚Äîvery useful for filtering columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explicit Control over Headers\n",
    "With DictWriter, you define the fieldnames, so it only writes what you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "csv.writer will blindly write any list you give it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Great for Working with APIs or JSON\n",
    "Most APIs return dictionaries or JSON objects. If you‚Äôre already working with dicts, DictReader/Writer fits naturally into the workflow."
